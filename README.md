<h1>Lab Assignment 2: Layout Components</h1>
<h2>
   In this lab assignment, we are instructed to extract the components written within a provided App.jsx file 
   into seperate component files; titled ToDoList.tsx and ToDoForm.tsx. We then must export these components
   using the Default Export and render them within an index.tsx file. Aside from component rendering, this application has no functionality.
</h2>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Hard Code ToDo List and Form</h3>
<li>In your project directory, open the index.tsx file.</li>
<li>Inside the App component, hard code the ToDo list items and the form to add tasks. The code should resemble the attached App.tsx file.</li>
<h3>Part 2: Move Into Separate Files</h3>
<li>Create a new file named ToDoList.tsx in the project directory.</li>
<li>Copy the ScrollView containing the tasks from App.tsx and paste it into the ToDoList.tsx file.</li>
<li>Import the necessary components and styles into ToDoList.tsx.</li>
<h3>ToDoForm.jsx:</h3>
<li>Create a new file named ToDoForm.tsx in the project directory.</li>
<li>Copy the View containing the input field and button from index.tsx and paste it into the ToDoForm.tsx file.</li>
<li>Import the necessary components and styles into ToDoForm.jsx.</li>
<h3>Part 3: Import Separate Components</h3>
<li>In index.tsx, import the ToDoList and ToDoForm components.</li>
<li>Replace the hard-coded ToDo list and form sections with the components.</li>
